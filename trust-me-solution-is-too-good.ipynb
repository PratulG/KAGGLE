The most common category among the YouTube channels is \"Entertainment\" with 241 channels, followed by \"Music\" (202 channels) and \"People & Blogs\" (132 channels).\n","2.

There is a positive correlation between subscribers and both monthly and yearly earnings, suggesting that channels with more subscribers tend to earn more.\n","2. The correlation between video views and earnings is also positive, indicating that channels with more views tend to earn more.\n","\n","### Map View of Countries and Their Subscribers\n","The map view shows the top YouTube channel in each country with the most subscribers. Blue markers represent these top channels.\n","\n","### Channel Age Analysis and Channel Category Analysis\n","1. Older channels tend to have more subscribers and video views, but the correlation is not strong (around 0.14).\n","2. The category with the highest average number of subscribers and video views is \"Shows,\" while \"Tech\" has the lowest in both metrics.\n","\n","### Education and Urbanization Analysis\n","1. Gross tertiary education enrollment and urban population do not have a strong impact on channel metrics such as subscribers, video views, or earnings.\n","\n","### Top Earning Channels\n","1. The top earning channels have the highest monthly and yearly earnings.\n","\n","### Correlation between Unemployment Rate and Performance\n","1. There is almost no correlation between the unemployment rate and channel performance metrics.\n","\n","### Correlation between Latitude/Longitude and Performance\n","1. There is a weak correlation between latitude/longitude and channel performance metrics.\n","\n","### Subscribers vs. Video Views Analysis\n","1. There is a strong positive correlation (0.75) between the number of subscribers and the number of video views, suggesting that channels with more subscribers tend to have more views.\n","\n","![Flowchart](https://kroki.io/mermaid/svg/eNp1UllugzAQ_e8p5gLdLlApIUm3UEUtqVRZ-TAwEEswpmO7ET19jbPgqukPMp55y7xxzbLbQja9AJiID-0ylyPMpJUbuLy8g6nIdAe3N5BsJRE2BvIe3lxuClY5sgFJJbyrErX_4s5sBp6ATESimbGRVmmCHO0OkWCmqgoZyUKKllURAWYi1cbCSneukQyJtFhrVhgkX1zr5UBXo5FBed01WpawYPx0SEU_ss3Fr8bYsqdLtCPLUfvirNsDBayQK82tpAID29xY1Xp__iSZFNXRGPcilV0II7gNQsMQAy7bouLYywh7OPqFSY0wIdn0Ru1Rx8Ihkf5UHdGPYl66Ym8-5MK5JPW9v_jb_hS2evB-SnSsP59NY03Y-rz7dljfqzcTpKJsRoLlWYKl_7WuxOulpjqc_mdIRbyyL3MVv7JxpB_f4Ozn)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"03830a25","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"02149c99-b0bc-4b27-b4b4-38ddd95f3529","_uuid":"7bd8e48c-787a-4654-8fea-1e4859043a36","papermill":{"duration":0.010414,"end_time":"2023-08-07T16:49:16.59968","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-08-07T16:49:16.589266","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Load the Dataset"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"32b178f9","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c645bc1a-c731-4cfb-a23a-805f7d20a7ee","_uuid":"f9b7a6a7-5fa4-4d34-9f7e-b01bfe24788b","collapsed":false,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-07T16:49:16.625029Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-07T16:49:16.624088Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-07T16:49:16.716058Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-07T16:49:16.714992Z"},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"papermill":{"duration":0.10878,"end_time":"2023-08-07T16:49:16.719267","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-08-07T16:49:16.610487","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>rank</th>\n","      <th>Youtuber</th>\n","      <th>subscribers</th>\n","      <th>video views</th>\n","      <th>category</th>\n","      <th>Title</th>\n","      <th>uploads</th>\n","      <th>Country</th>\n","      <th>Abbreviation</th>\n","      <th>channel_type</th>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <th>subscribers_for_last_30_days</th>\n","      <th>created_year</th>\n","      <th>created_month</th>\n","      <th>created_date</th>\n","      <th>Gross tertiary education enrollment (%)</th>\n","      <th>Population</th>\n","      <th>Unemployment rate</th>\n","      <th>Urban_population</th>\n","      <th>Latitude</th>\n","      <th>Longitude</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>T-Series</td>\n","      <td>245000000</td>\n","      <td>2.280000e+11</td>\n","      <td>Music</td>\n","      <td>T-Series</td>\n","      <td>20082</td>\n","      <td>India</td>\n","      <td>IN</td>\n","      <td>Music</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>2000000.0</td>\n","      <td>2006.0</td>\n","      <td>Mar</td>\n","      <td>13.0</td>\n","      <td>28.1</td>\n","      <td>1.366418e+09</td>\n","      <td>5.36</td>\n","      <td>471031528.0</td>\n","      <td>20.593684</td>\n","      <td>78.962880</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>YouTube Movies</td>\n","      <td>170000000</td>\n","      <td>0.000000e+00</td>\n","      <td>Film &amp;

This suggests that channels with a larger subscriber base are likely to have more views on their videos."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"id":"4667fed1","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"fcbb8230-60aa-4617-b7e4-4fa8fbefaf6c","_uuid":"33b2f230-63f7-4071-80e8-f4924b593983","collapsed":false,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-07T16:49:18.248645Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-07T16:49:18.247494Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-07T16:49:18.275765Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-07T16:49:18.274665Z"},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"papermill":{"duration":0.04962,"end_time":"2023-08-07T16:49:18.27838","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-08-07T16:49:18.22876","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["(United States     313\n"," India             168\n"," Brazil             62\n"," United Kingdom     43\n"," Mexico             33\n"," Indonesia          28\n"," Spain              22\n"," Thailand           18\n"," South Korea        17\n"," Russia             16\n"," Name: Country, dtype: int64,\n","                 subscribers   video views  highest_monthly_earnings  \\\n"," channel_type                                                          \n"," Animals        1.953333e+07  1.471175e+10              2.833333e+06   \n"," Autos          2.146667e+07  6.525849e+09              4.666701e+05   \n"," Comedy         2.085686e+07  8.885109e+09              7.444748e+05   \n"," Education      2.653469e+07  1.560828e+10              7.542673e+05   \n"," Entertainment  2.277138e+07  1.109175e+10              7.027955e+05   \n"," Film           2.296190e+07  1.093435e+10              4.646072e+05   \n"," Games          2.154694e+07  7.414359e+09              3.522757e+05   \n"," Howto          1.803056e+07  5.434740e+09              2.356722e+05   \n"," Music          2.671991e+07  1.505897e+10              5.715817e+05   \n"," News           2.039000e+07  1.037843e+10              7.016400e+05   \n"," Nonprofit      2.775000e+07  5.431456e+09              3.904000e+05   \n"," People         1.933960e+07  8.771476e+09              6.757054e+05   \n"," Sports         2.780769e+07  1.393115e+10              6.597154e+05   \n"," Tech           1.887059e+07  3.491502e+09              2.203588e+05   \n"," \n","                highest_yearly_earnings  \n"," channel_type                            \n"," Animals                   3.390000e+07  \n"," Autos                     5.666707e+06  \n"," Comedy                    8.963068e+06  \n"," Education                 9.034639e+06  \n"," Entertainment             8.443108e+06  \n"," Film                      5.582405e+06  \n"," Games                     4.207925e+06  \n"," Howto                     2.840464e+06  \n"," Music                     6.875110e+06  \n"," News                      8.393373e+06  \n"," Nonprofit                 4.700000e+06  \n"," People                    8.106875e+06  \n"," Sports                    7.866638e+06  \n"," Tech                      2.635200e+06  ,\n","                        Youtuber  subscribers_for_last_30_days\n"," 2                       MrBeast                     8000000.0\n"," 417                DaFuq!?Boom!                     6700000.0\n"," 117               Jess No Limit                     5500000.0\n"," 332  ZAMZAM ELECTRONICS TRADING                     3400000.0\n"," 483                 BeatboxJCOP                     3400000.0\n"," 302         KL BRO Biju Rithvik                     3200000.0\n"," 495            Ã½Ã½Ã½Ã½Ã½Ã½Ã½Ã½Ã½ KIMPRO                     3200000.0\n"," 598                Panda Shorts                     3000000.0\n"," 132               BETER BÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½                     2100000.0\n"," 0                      T-Series                     2000000.0,\n","                        Youtuber  video_views_for_the_last_30_days\n"," 286                 Happy Lives                      6.589000e+09\n"," 455      Dan-Sa / Daniel Saboya                      6.148000e+09\n"," 495            Ã½Ã½Ã½Ã½Ã½Ã½Ã½Ã½Ã½ KIMPRO                      3.404000e+09\n"," 417                DaFuq!?Boom!                      2.304000e+09\n"," 902               Calon Sarjana                      2.292000e+09\n"," 0                      T-Series                      2.258000e+09\n"," 302         KL BRO Biju Rithvik                      2.033000e+09\n"," 3    Cocomelon - Nursery Rhymes                      1.975000e+09\n"," 4                     SET India                      1.824000e+09\n"," 21                       Zee TV                      1.707000e+09)"]},"execution_count":12,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# 1.
